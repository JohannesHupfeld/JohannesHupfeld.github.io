<p>I am a part time online student at Flatiron School for software engineering. I was born in Copenhagen, Denmark but grew up in NYC, Warsaw Poland, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. I recently moved back to the east coast after living in Portland oregon for the last ten years where I studied and received a bachelors in Film. I moved back east to be closer to family after a tragic loss in our family. life if short and you never know when it can be over so I've decided to go for my dreams and pursue a new career that Im sure will bring an exciting future for me. </p>
