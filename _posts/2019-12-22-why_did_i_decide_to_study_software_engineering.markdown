There are several reasons why I decided to venture into the world of software engineering.

Ive always been interested in problem solving and puzzles and in some way software engineering is like solving a puzzle. The concept of learning a language that allows you to create and manipulate applications and software seems like an extraordinary talent that I would really enjoy being able to do. With software engineering you are able to apply your skills to so many different companies and in a way work for something you truly believe in and something that really sold me on the idea of getting into this field.

There are also personal reasons I decided software engineering would be a good fit for me. Having lived a semi bicoastal lifestyle for a long time it seemed that a career in software would allow me most flexibility with working remotely and allowing me to continue living a bicoastal lifestyle. 

Im truly excited to dive into the world of software and see how far this can take me.
