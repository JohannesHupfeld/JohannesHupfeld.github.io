I decided that for my Sinatra MVC/CRUD project I would create an app to store and share recipes. I consider myself to be an avid cook so I’m always either creating new recipes or looking up something interesting to make. Noting down my recipes in a sticky notes or keeping a note book isn’t always ideal so my other option was to note it down in my notes app on my iPhone. This prevented me from loosing or spilling on my perishable paper notes but it didn’t help with organization. Another aspect I wanted to implement was being able to see what other people are coming up with. Of course I could go on line and simply search up different recipes but my problem with that was you are always left with having to read an essay in order to find the recipe hidden within. I wanted to create an app to store all your recipes digitally and to also be able to see other peoples recipes without out any story attached to them and that is what the CookBook app is. This app is the first of its kind that I’ve created and therefore is rather basic but holds the potential to become so much more. Perhaps in the future I would like to add a “Show Me What I Can Make” feature in which a user can list items they have lying around the house and the app will generate what can be made with those ingredients by scraping the database of recipes created on the app.

### Project Setup 

Instead of creating the entire file structure from scratch I decided to use [Corneal](https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal).
